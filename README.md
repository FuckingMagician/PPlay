# PPlay
These are python projects developed using the framework PPlay. I developed these projects for the Game Programming Lab class at Universidade Federal Fluminense.

There will be 2 games here, the first one I developed was the game Pong and later I developed a space invaders(will be posted soon).

Both games aren't perfect and there might have some mistakes in the code that may lead to some bugs (I'll update the code here if I make some change), since I am still learning and it was my first experience making games. However I believe that these codes can be helpful to people that are learning how to code with Python and PPlay, mainly to people that are taking the same class I did.
