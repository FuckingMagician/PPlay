# PPlay
These are python projects developed using the framework PPlay. I developed these projects for the Game Programming Lab class at Universidade Federal Fluminense.

There will be 2 games here, the first one I developed was the game Pong and later Space Invaders.

I believe that these codes can be helpful to people that are learning how to code with Python, mainly to people that are taking the same class I did.
